        <p class="about-text">
            At HomeHub Agency, we are excited to introduce our External Agent Program, 
            designed to reward you for helping us connect buyers and sellers. 
            Hereâ€™s how it works:
        </p>
  
        <div class="callout">
        
        <strong><p>Earn 5% Commission:</strong> As an external agent, you will earn a 5% commission for every successful 
            transaction you facilitate. This applies whether you bring a buyer who purchases a property 
            through our platform or if you post a property listing on our platform.</p><br>

        <strong><p>How It Works:</p></strong>
                <strong><p>For Buyers:</strong> If you refer a buyer who successfully purchases a property listed on HomeHub Agency, 
                    you will receive a 5% commission of the total transaction amount.</p> <br>

                <strong><p>For Sellers:</strong> If you post a property on our platform and it gets sold or rented through our services, 
                    you will also earn a 5% commission based on the transaction amount.</p><br>
            
        <strong><p>Commission Structure:</strong> HomeHub Agency takes a 10% commission on each transaction. From this, 5% is allocated 
                to you, the external agent, and the remaining 5% is retained by us.</p><br>
  
        <p>Get Started: Signing up is simple. Register for the External Agent Program, start referring buyers or 
                posting properties, and begin earning your commissions.</p>
